    <string name="what_title">What is Studyless</string>
    <string name="what_body">With Studyless I wanted to develop an old idea of communicating through morse code using vibrations, this is a quite more expanded version of that. It is a non-intrusive way of comunicating, you may use it the way you like</string>
    <string name="how_title">How to use</string>
    <string name="how_body">To use it you first have to join a room, at start time you are assigned a random room but you can change it in the button of the question list. Once in a room you will see all of them in neutral state, now all your friends can join (the more the better) and begin choosing answers. \n The most voted will appear in place of "Not sure"</string>
    <string name="how_vibrations_title">How vibrations works</string>
    <string name="how_vibrations_body">If you want to go to the next level, you can use the phone vibration to retrieve the answers. To do so, you need the device unlocked and the app open (It is recommenced to deactivate the look screen and leave the app open) then you are going to use the volume down key to select the question, each press counts in a sum, so if you are interested in the 4th question you have to press the volume down key 4 times, for the 5th five times and so onâ€¦ After one second without key presses the device will vibrate gibing you the most voted answer in the following way:\n1 short vibration = A\n2 short vibrations = B\n3 short vibrations = C\n4 short vibrations = D\nAnd 1 long vibration means that there is no clear answer\n\n**</string>
    <string name="tips_title">Tips</string>
    <string name="tips_body">To get a better experience you should desactivate the lock screen to be able to use the vibrations functionality without looking at the screen as the vibrations doesn\'t work when the phone is locked</string>
